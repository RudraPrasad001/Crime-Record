Title: Java Criminal Records Management System (Beginner Project)

Description:

This beginner-friendly Java program simulates a basic criminal records management system. It allows users to:

Add criminals: Record essential information about criminals, such as name, crime committed, and sentence duration.
Remove criminals: Efficiently delete records of criminals who have completed their sentences, promoting a clean database.
Sentence assignment: Based on the type of crime (simulated through user input), the program assigns appropriate sentence durations.
Time skip simulation: Users can simulate the passage of time, enabling them to check if criminals are eligible for record removal (based on their completed sentences).
